# 📘 J.P. Morgan – Quantitative Research Job Simulation (Forage)

This repository contains my completed work for the **J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Virtual Experience** on Forage.  
The program simulates core tasks performed by quantitative researchers at J.P. Morgan, combining **data analysis**, **financial modelling**, and **risk analytics**.

The project is divided into **four modules**, each representing a realistic quantitative workflow.

# 🔍 1 — Investigate and Analyze Price Data

### **Objective**  
Explore historical price data to extract meaningful patterns, understand risk characteristics.

### **What I did**  
- Loaded and cleaned price time series.  
- Predictions with OLS estimator and ANCOVA
- Interpreted results with a quantitative finance perspective.

### **Skills used**  
`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, time-series analytics.

# 📦 2 — Price a Commodity Storage Contract

### **Objective**  
Estimate the value of a simplified **commodity storage contract**, integrating price behaviour and operational constraints.

### **What I did**  
- Modelled commodity spot prices as a time series.  
- Incorporated storage limits, injection/withdrawal constraints, and operational costs.  

### **Key concepts**  
Commodity price modelling • Optionality in storage.

# 💳 3 — Credit Risk Analysis

### **Objective**  
Build a simple credit risk model and estimate borrowers’ **Probability of Default (PD)**.

### **What I did**  
- Performed EDA on credit data.  
- Trained logistic regression 
- Evaluated results with precision, recall, f1-score, confusion matrix.  

### **Key concepts**  
Binary classification • Credit modelling • Performance metrics.

# 📊 4 — Bucket FICO Scores

### **Objective**  
Transform continuous FICO credit scores into **risk buckets** used for pricing, capital, and risk management.

### **What I did**  
- Analysed distribution of FICO scores and default patterns.  
- Created risk buckets (Low → Very High Risk).  
- Ensured monotonic relationship between bucket and observed PD.  

### **Key concepts**  
Risk segmentation • Scorecard modelling • Default rate analysis.

# 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.9+**  
- `pandas`, `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- Jupyter Notebook

# 🎯 Key Takeaways

Through this simulation, I gained hands-on experience in:

- Handling **realistic financial datasets**.  
- Implementing **pricing logic**, **risk models**, and **statistical analysis**.  
- Building and evaluating **PD models**.  
- Translating financial intuition into quantitative tools.  
- Communicating modelling insights clearly.

This project reflects the day-to-day workflow of a **Quantitative Research Analyst**, emphasizing analysis, modelling, and rigorous reasoning.
